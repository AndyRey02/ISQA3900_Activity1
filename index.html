            <p>

            My name is Andrew Reyes, and I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Omaha at Nebraska.
            Currently studying for a degree in Management Information Systems. I'm excited to start my first senior
            semester after completing what will hopefully be my last summer semester of my college career. On my
                spare time from working and school I enjoy spending time with my family and working
            on whatever car projects I have lying around.

             Here are some of my some photos of my current projects,
                first photo is of my 2001 Ford Mustang GT Deluxe and second photo is of my sister and mine's motorcycles.

            This is a very simple, sample site to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills.
            This is a great way to refresh crucial web development skills.
