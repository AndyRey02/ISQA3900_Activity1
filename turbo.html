                  He was adopted when he was about 6 months old. Here he is wearing his snow hat.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:center">We're not sure what he's mixed with, but he's definitely some sort
                    of terreir mix. I was fortunate enough to adopt Turbo when he was about 6 months old and quickly learn how much of
                     a handful he is. He also firmly believes he is part cat.</p>
